		<p>i was interested in recreating my neocities friend's site, ribo.zone..specifically the 'plants ive eaten' page. they used wikipedia's clade template, which has a scientific diagram look that fits the rest of their laboratory themed website. <br><br>

		the clade template uses lua, a programming language that i am currently learning in my game programming class. after digging a bit, i realized i probably had to generate the page by building it in wikipedia itself, and i don't feel like making an account so i will approach this from a purely html/css angle.</p>
