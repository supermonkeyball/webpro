		<p>i was interested in recreating my neocities friend's site, ribo.zone..specifically the 'plants ive eaten' page. they used wikipedia's clade template, which has a scientific diagram look that fits the rest of their laboratory themed website. <br><br>

the clade template uses lua, a programming language that i am currently learning in my game programming class. </p>
